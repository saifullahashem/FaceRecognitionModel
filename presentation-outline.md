# Presentation outline — Face Recognition Model (Team 6)

Slide 1 — Title
- Project: Face Recognition Model
- Team 6
- Saifullah (maintainer)

Slide 2 — Problem & Goal
- Goal: build a simple face recognition pipeline using HOG features, PCA, and classical ML classifiers (SVM / KNN / Logistic Regression).
- Use-case: small-scale identification / demo.

Slide 3 — Data
- Describe dataset (how images are stored, naming convention like `label_filename.jpg`).
- Mention any preprocessing (grayscale, resizing, HOG extraction).

Slide 4 — Pipeline
- HOG feature extraction (skimage)
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Train/test split and models (SVC, KNN, Logistic Regression)

Slide 5 — Results
- Show accuracy, confusion matrix, and short analysis of failure cases.

Slide 6 — How to run
- Activate venv, install `requirements.txt`, open `face_recognition_notebook.ipynb`.

Slide 7 — Limitations & Next steps
- Discuss dataset size, bias, better feature extractors (deep learning / pretrained face embeddings), production concerns.

Slide 8 — Contact
- Saifullah — maintainer

Use this outline to quickly create a PowerPoint or Google Slides deck. If you want, I can also generate a `.pptx` file from this outline.
