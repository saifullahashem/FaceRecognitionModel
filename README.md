# Face Recognition Model — Team 6

Small face recognition project implemented as a Jupyter notebook. This repository contains the code, the notebook, and supporting files needed to run and present the project.

What you'll find here
- `face_recognition_notebook.ipynb` — cleaned notebook (same content as the original `Team 6 Code.ipynb`, but with a shorter name).
- `.gitignore` — ignores common Python / Jupyter artifacts.
- `requirements.txt` — Python packages required to run the notebook locally.
- `presentation-outline.md` — a short slide outline you can paste into PowerPoint / Google Slides for presenting.

Quick start (for beginners)
1. Install Python 3.8+ and create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Open the notebook with Jupyter Lab / Notebook locally:

```bash
jupyter lab
# then open face_recognition_notebook.ipynb in the browser
```

Notes about Colab
- The original notebook used `google.colab.files` to upload data. That works on Google Colab. If you run locally, upload or place your dataset (e.g. `Faces.zip`) in a folder and update the notebook paths accordingly.

Publishing checklist (what I already did)
- Renamed the main notebook to `face_recognition_notebook.ipynb` for a cleaner filename.
- Added `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, and an MIT `LICENSE`.
- Added a short presentation outline in `presentation-outline.md` you can use to build slides.

If you want, I can also:
- Merge the notebook outputs (clear or keep outputs) before publishing.
- Create a real PowerPoint file (`.pptx`) from the outline.
